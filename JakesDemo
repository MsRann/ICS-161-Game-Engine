Here is a small demo showing the seamless change in backgrounds and my frame duration implementation.

Latest commit:
Here is a working version of the SceneManager.  It will change between "Level One" and "Level Two" by pressing the keys 1 and 2.  It remembers the Scientist
	object's position but it currently carries over the direction the Sprite is facing when changing levels (in "Level One"" if you face left, then switch to
	"Level Two" and face right, if you switch back to "Level One" it will now be facing right).  I do not think this will be hard to fix, but I have other
	things to work on at the moment.
